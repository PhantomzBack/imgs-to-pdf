# imgs-to-pdf
Put images in a folder and this will compile them and make a PDF
# How To Setup
Choose the images you want to and put them in the same folder as the .EXE(executable) or the .PY(Python file). The dependencies while running python script will need to be installed manually(if not installed already)
# How To Use
Run the script or the executable. The executable is a shell executable and might take some time to load as it has to load the depencdencies packaged with the software.
There is currently a limit of 100 images which will soon be taken off. The format is to be 01.{ext}, 02.{ext} and so on. They will automatically be detected if listed in the right manner.
Once it is run, you will be able to see the number of files found. Once the PDF is created, the executable prints "Done".
# Result
The final product can be found in the same folder with the name "compiled.pdf"
# More Information
